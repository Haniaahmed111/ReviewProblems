# Review Problems – Week [Your Week Number]

This solution contains multiple small C# console programs that review basic programming concepts such as arithmetic operations, loops, conditionals, functions, and OOP.

Each activity is implemented in a separate project named according to its title.

---

### Activity 48 – ArithmeticOperations
Reads two integers from the console and displays their sum, product, difference, quotient, and remainder.

###  Activity 49 – MultiplesOfNumbers
Determines whether the first number is a multiple of the second number using the modulo operator.

###  Activity 50 – DigitSumForeach
Reads an integer and calculates the sum of its digits using a foreach loop to iterate over each character.

### Activity 51 – DigitSumModulo
Calculates the sum of digits of an integer using modulo (%) and division (/) in a while loop.

###  Activity 52 – DecisionBasedOnBooleans
Asks three yes/no questions and decides whether you should go to the lecture based on boolean conditions.

###  Activity 53 – SentenceFromWords
Builds a sentence by reading words one by one (including punctuation) and then printing the full sentence.

###  Activity 54 – AdultCorpulenceIndex
Calculates an adult’s Corpulence Index (CI = mass / height³), rounds it to two decimals, and classifies the category (e.g., underweight, normal, overweight).

###  Activity 55 – OOPBasedTodoApp
Implements a simple object-oriented to-do list app with `TodoItem` and `TodoList` classes that allow adding, listing, and marking tasks as done.
